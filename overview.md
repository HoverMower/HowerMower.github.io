## HoverMower Overview
[Find a 360 degree render here ](/render/Mower_rotation.html)

## Chassis details
The chassis consists of only a few but large parts. The front section (white in images) acts as a bumper. This part is not attached fixed to the rest of chassis. 
Instead there are silicone or rupper dampers, which allows the front cover to move a bit. If the robot hits an obstacle, front cover will slide from its origin position.
This mis-placement triggers micro switches. This way, robot can detect, if it hits an obstacle or not.
