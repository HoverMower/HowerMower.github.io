## Lower Chassis

The lower chassis is the main structural part meaning your robot will be able to drive around only with these parts.
These parts are the housing of motors, battery, Hoverboard PCB and some other electronics.

It only consists of six parts:
- Motor body lower
- Motor body upper
- Motor clamp 2x
- Wheel arch 
- Wheel arch mirror
- Mow lower
- Mow upper

## Rear section
This part of lower chassis consists of the first five parts (see list above). The motor clamps are used to secure hub motors to the Motor_body_lower part.
Use 8 M5 screws to bold it down. At top of Motor_body_lower, you find six holes for M3 knurled  nuts, which are used to mount Motor_body_upper and Motor_body_lower together.
Inside the Motor_body_lower, you find lots of holes, which can also take knurled brass nuts M3. As I tried to keep the chassis independent of electronics, it is up to you 
which hole needs to be equipped with a brass nut. Don't waste your money by placing nuts in all of these holes.

To mount wheel arches to Motor_body_lower, you first need to insert 4 knurled brass nuts M4 into each wheel mount. You find the corresponding holes at the inner side of wheel arches.
Use 4x M4x12 screws and washers to mount each wheel arch. 

You need to place five knurled brass nuts M3 also into Motor_body_upper part. Four of them are used at the upper most level. Here you can add a cover or box for
push buttons, kill switches, screens or whatever you want. This cover gets secured with M3 screws. To seal this cover, you can add a piece of sponge rubber cord into the groove. 
Use superglue to keep it in place, if needed.
The last brass nut gets used to keep PCB Box in place. You find this hole at the front (torwards Mow section), right beneath one of the M3 screw holes.

## Front section
The front section consists of two parts only. These parts will be the housing of mow motors and maybe additional electronics. 
Therefore, lots of holes for knurled brass nuts M3 are available. Again, please insert them only into holes you need. There is no reason to place a nut into each single hole.
On top of Mow_lower, you find eight holes for, again knurled brass nuts M3. You must equip them as they are used to mount Mow_upper and Mow_lower together.

To route cables between front section and PCB Box, a large cutout has been designed in Mow_upper. As the PCB Box is detachable, plugs like D-SUB connectors are used here, which are mounted to a separate cover.
It also provide a groove to seal this cover. Add eight knurled brass nuts M3 into Mow_upper. These will secure the cover and also your plugable connectors.

## Combine Front and Back section
Both sections gets combined by using 10 M5x18 screws, 10 M5 nuts and 20 washers M5. You can route your cables between both sections by using one of the four
large cut outs. Between both sections, rubber O-Ring with an inner diameter of 35mm are used for sealing. Alternatively, you can use some silicone.
