## Print instructions

This page contains information about how to print HoverMower

## Printer requirements
All parts are designed to be printed on a 3D printer by FFM/FDM technology. 
Your print volume needs to be at least 300mm x 300mm x 200mm. Please note that smaller printers are not supported.

## Filament
Your mower will work outside so you need a material which is water tight and UV resistant. Also it will operate on sunny days which results in heat up. 
It is up to you to use material as you want by any brand. I highly recommend not to use PLA as you might observe some failure caused by heat (sun or heat dissipating by electronics)
Instead I recommend using ABS or even ASA, which is more UV resistant. However I had great success with PETG on my other mowers and projects.
They all survived outdoors for several years and I build this project again with PETG.

## Print settings
I printed my parts with these settings:
- 0.2mm Layer height
- 0.4mm Nozzle
- 4 Bottom and 4 Top Layer
- 4 Perimeter
- 18% Infill

The parts has been designed to be printable with mostly no support. This doesn't mean you can print them without. You will definately need to use support.
