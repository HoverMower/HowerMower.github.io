## Mount Caster block 
The caster block is used to mount caster wheel to lower chassis. My initial intention was to be able to detect, if mower has been lifted.
In such a case, it has to stop immediately and especially, turn off dangerous mow motor. But I wasn't able to add a micro switch or hall sensor
so far. To complete my build, I left this option and build a simple block. THIS PART NEEDS TO BE RE-DESIGNED. If you have any ideas, your contribution is welcome.

To mount the block, you need really long M5 screws which are 2x M5x45 and 2x M5x50. Also you need four M5 nuts and two M5 washers.
To ease printing, there is a bridge below the large, center hole. First you need to drill or cut the hole through the entire length and remove the bridge.
Now insert two M5 nuts at the bottom of the caster block. You may need to use superglue to keep them in place.

Next, simple bold the caster block to the lower chassis. Use M5x45 as vertical bolds. Here  don't use washers. Next, use M5x50 and bold them horizontically by using washers and nuts.

## Prepare caster wheel
You need a caster wheel, one M8x35mm screw nut and washer. Also you need one threaded socket M8x25 with 11mm outer diameter. The initial idea behind this was, 
if mower gets liftet, the caster wheel will slide throuh the caster block and trigger a switch. That's the reason for the threaded socket as it acts as a guide.

## Combine caster block and caster wheel
Simply push the prepared caster wheel from bottom to top through caster block. Use a M8 washer and M8 nut to secure the caster wheel.
