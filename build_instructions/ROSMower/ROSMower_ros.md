## ROSMower Software
ROSMower is a HoverMower controlled by ROS, robot operating system. It runs with ROS Melodic on a NVidia Jetson B01 SBC. 
I use JetPack 4.6, which is an Ubuntu distribution specially tailored to NVidia Jetson.
The following section describes different aspects of how to build and control ROSMower. This is mainly for my personal reference but you're welcome to pick what ever you need.
