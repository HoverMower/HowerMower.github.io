## Front Chassis

The front chassis acts as cover of the mower. It covers mow disc and blades. Also it acts as a bumper to detect collisions with obstacles.

It consists of seven parts:
- Front cover 
- Front cover (mirrored)
- Nose left
- Nose right
- Bumper front
- Bumper side
- Bumper side (mirrored)

The two parts Nose left and Nose right are not easy to print. You find large overhangs with steep angles. Also you will need lot of support to be able to print.
