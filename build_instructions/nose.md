## Nose
The nose consists of two parts. Because space is really limited here (caused by caster wheel), you need to glue both halfes together.
To help you with alignment and also to hold parts in place while your glue does its job, M3x10 scew, washer and nut gets used. I used some 2k epoxy glue but 
you can use any water resistant glue.

The large cut-outs can be used to equip your robot with additional sensors. I will use them to place some LED which came with hoverboard just for fun.
