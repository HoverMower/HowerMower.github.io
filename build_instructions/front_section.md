## Front section
The front section consists of two parts only. These parts will be the housing of mow motors and maybe additional electronics.

Therefore, lots of holes for knurled brass nuts M3 are available. Again, please insert them only into holes you need. There is no reason to place a nut into each single hole.
On top of Mow_lower, you find eight holes for, again knurled brass nuts M3. You must equip them as they are used to mount Mow_upper and Mow_lower together.

To route cables between front section and PCB Box, a large cutout has been designed in Mow_upper. As the PCB Box is detachable, plugs like D-SUB connectors are used here, which are mounted to a separate cover.
It also provide a groove to seal this cover. Add eight knurled brass nuts M3 into Mow_upper. These will secure the cover and also your plugable connectors.
