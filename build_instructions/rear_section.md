## Rear section

![](/render/Motor-section.png)

This part of lower chassis consists of the first five parts (see list above). The motor clamps are used to secure hub motors to the Motor_body_lower part.
Use 8 M5 screws to bold it down. At top of Motor_body_lower, you find six holes for M3 knurled  nuts, which are used to mount Motor_body_upper and Motor_body_lower together.
Inside the Motor_body_lower, you find lots of holes, which can also take knurled brass nuts M3. As I tried to keep the chassis independent of electronics, it is up to you 
which hole needs to be equipped with a brass nut. Don't waste your money by placing nuts in all of these holes.

To mount wheel arches to Motor_body_lower, you first need to insert 4 knurled brass nuts M4 into each wheel mount. You find the corresponding holes at the inner side of wheel arches.
Use 4x M4x12 screws and washers to mount each wheel arch.

You need to place five knurled brass nuts M3 also into Motor_body_upper part. Four of them are used at the upper most level. Here you can add a cover or box for
push buttons, kill switches, screens or whatever you want. This cover gets secured with M3 screws. To seal this cover, you can add a piece of sponge rubber cord into the groove. 
Use superglue to keep it in place, if needed.
The last brass nut gets used to keep PCB Box in place. You find this hole at the front (torwards Mow section), right beneath one of the M3 screw holes.
