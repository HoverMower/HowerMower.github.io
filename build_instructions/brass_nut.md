## Knurled brass nuts

Knurled brass nuts are thread inserts, which can be mold into plastic. At HoverMower they are used at all places which might be screwed and unsrewed multiple times.
All Covers and lids are equipped with them. This way, it is easy to open a cover multiple times during build without to wear out threads, like self-tapering screws
will do. Also they are used on places where it is hard to insert common hex nuts.

For details about which kind ob brass nuts are used, please refer to BOM.

## Instructions

You need a soldering iron with an large tip. There are also special soldering tips available for molding brass nuts into plastic.
First of all, heat up your soldering iron to an temperature above melting point of material you use. For example, PETG should be at least 250Â°C.

Now place the brass nuts into the holes. There is a groove at one side of the nuts. This must be inserted first.
