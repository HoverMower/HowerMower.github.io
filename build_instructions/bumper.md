## Bumper
As you see in the pictures of front chassis, there are some red parts at the bottom. These three parts are named bumper and will add some rigidy
to the front chassis. Also they will ensure to cover the mow disc and blades. Because they might collid with stones, ground or similar, they will wear down by time.
Therefore, I designed them as separate parts, so it is easy to replace them.

To attach the bumper, you first need to insert some M3 knurled brass nuts. You already did this for lower chassis so you should be familiar with this step. 
You need 22 of them in total

Now, simple screw the three bumper parts to front cover by using some M3x15 screws, again 22 in total. You can also use two M3x10 counter sunk screws and nuts to
combine the bumper parts to one structural unit.

## Congratulations
Your front cover should look like this when finalized.
