## D-Sub 25 plugs
Two pairs of D-Sub 25 connectors are used to route power and signals between PCB Box and mower chassis. I'm not sure if it is a good decision to use this
kind of connectors, but time will tell us.

Two 3D printed parts are used to keep D-Sub connectors in place. One gets mounted into PCB Box, the other to lower chassis. Again, I use some O-Ring as sealing, which are
- O-Ring 83mm ID, 2mm thickness
- O-Ring 107mm ID, 2mm thickness

Place them into the groove of each plate, use some super glue to fix, if needed.
