## Mount Hoverboard Motors to rear section

To mount the motors, you need the two printed parts "Motor_clamp", eight M5x35mm screws, eight M5 hex nuts and eight M5 washers.
Just slide the motors into Motor_lower through the holes starting with the cables. There is no need to remove the plug housing as they should fit into the holes.
Now bolt down the motor with the motor clamp part. Don't forget to add washers to the screws. At the bottom of Motor_lower, you can insert the M5 nuts.

The motors shouldn't slide or move anymore. You need to screw tight but no need to hulk it down.
Your rear section should look like this now.
