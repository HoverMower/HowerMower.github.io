## My Bill of material
As the BOM, bill of material only contains parts needed to build the HoverMower chassis, this more special BOM contains additional parts I used
to build my version of HoverMower. Please use this only as reference as it higly depends on which kind of electronic and software you plan to use. 
My version will be equipped with ROS (Robot Operating System) as software stack.
